## About
[Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_(game)), (or sometimes called, "Ring of Fire"), is a popular turn-based group drinking game, which may or may not be responsible for all the evils in the world today.

It is designed to keep the alcohol flowing, and gets more complex as each turn progresses. While there are myriad different versions of the game, this project was built around the version I used to play.

## Aims
This program was written so I could try to improve my beginner Python skills by doing something outside the usual tutorials. I wanted to write something enjoyable and fun, and that I might actually get to use (even though I'm too old to survive such a game now).

The project taught me more about using command line input/output, importing data from other files, and getting to grips with tracking changes to a program as it runs. It was also a nice chance to use the [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet) library.

I had such great fun making this project, that I'm planning on developing it into a full webapp with a proper UI at a later date.

## Features:
- Game description and explanation of rules.
- Ability to store player names, and track turns.
- Cards are automatically shuffled with each game, and dealt by pressing 'Enter'.
- Each deal displays whose turn it is, how many cards are left in the deck, and how many Kings there are left in the game.

## Possible Improvements:
- Graphical web-based UI.
- Ability to modify and store customised card rules.
- Improved "user-proofing" of inputs.
